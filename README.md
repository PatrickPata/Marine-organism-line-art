# Marine-organism-line-art
Line art of marine organisms created by Patrick Pata. Most organisms are zooplankton and are being used in P. Pata's research. These are provided in PNG and SVG formats. Files are named generally according to the taxonomic group the organisms were made to represent.

Please note that the organisms were vectorized from personsal sketches and were not intended to represent morphological structures accurately.
